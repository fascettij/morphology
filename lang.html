In freshman year of high school, I found my love for learning language. This one Spanish teacher that I had, for a reason that I still haven’t figured out, was the one who made me realize that I loved learning languages. I’m still far from fluency in everything but English, but the teacher saw the interest that I had and helped me run with it. I remember in class one day, we were learning about the past tense. On my own, I had looked a bit into it, but learned nothing significant. When we were introduced to it in class, I understood it with ease, but for some reason, everyone else in the class was struggling with it. While the teacher was explaining it again for the third time, I drifted into a crazy thought: what if I actually became fluent in Spanish? It seemed so outrageous at the time, yet almost tangible. At the end of that class, they gave me extra material to work with and I ate it up that night. I came back the next day wanting more, and they gave me more. This repeated for the rest of the term. On the last day of class, we talked about what the future of me as a language student looked like, and they suggested that I go as far as starting to learn another language. The idea baffled me at first -- I could barely wrap my head around being fluent in Spanish, so how was I supposed to start over on a new language? Nevertheless, I took Arabic the following year and proved to have a consistent learning style.

Part way through freshman year, I was in the car with my mom one evening driving home. It was a day or two after parent-teacher conferences and it was the first time that our busy schedules lined up, she was talking to me about each of the meetings. When she got to Spanish, she explained to me how impressed my teacher was with how quickly I picked up on it. She transitioned into an unventured realm of our conversation. She asked me if I remembered back in fourth and fifth grade going to get tested for my reading skills. I said that I remembered, but didn’t know anything of it -- I thought everyone had done it. She later told me that when the results came back, they had diagnosed me with being on dyslexia and dysgraphia spectrum. I knew what dyslexia was, but dysgraphia was a new term to me. She explained that it meant that I have trouble putting my thoughts onto paper, that I know what to say, but not know how to say it. Since my mom and I rarely have sentimental conversations like that, the rest of the drive home was audiably silent, yet you could tell that our minds were occupied to ourselves. On the rest of the drive, I thought about how much sense that made, all the times that I am talking and my words come out as jumbles, writing fragments upon fragments, or getting frustrated while reading something. We got home and didn’t speak another word of it until that night, as I was saying goodnight to her, she told me, “You know, when they told us that you have dyslexia and dysgraphia, they said that you would never be able to learn another language. But look where you are now, I’m proud of you.”
