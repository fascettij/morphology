It was not just in Russian Math that I felt like my parents would guide me toward the STEM world. As a young child, learning like that was the only thing I knew; I just thought that everyone was doing it but not talking about it. (I continued the program for many years to come) I vividly remember the first time I picked up the book The Number Thief, written by Hans Magnus Enzensberger. It was one early afternoon in third grade. My sister and dad were out of the house for whatever reason and my mother was somewhere waist deep in work from a mini crisis happening at work. I recall vigilantly crept across the creaky, uneven wooden floors into my sister’s room. I was terrified because this was not my first attempt at going into room and all other attempts resulted in getting caught mid operation. As younger brothers do, I snooped around her room not expecting to find anything in particular, first to under her bed to see if she had any goodies hidden away -- I didn’t find anything. Then to the closet with equal results. Then I got to the bookshelf to see if there was anything interesting.

A curious black, spined red book caught my eye, I used my index finger to tilt the small book out at a 45º angle like I was opening a secret passage into a new world of learning. The cover was a warm blood red with an outline of a devil, but rather holding a blivet shaped pitch fork, he held ajjn unproportionally sized, innocent pencil. I flipped through the 250 page book with curiosity for what knowledge the pretentious cover was hiding behind it. I remember seeing pictures, graphs and equations (oh my!) that kept me invested in the possibilities in the math that I had yet to discover. I stayed lying on my stomach on my sister’s rosy red carpet, forcing myself to start at the beginning of the book so I could read and take in all that I could. I don’t know how much time passed that afternoon, but I was well into the lesson (on the beautiful phenomena of multiplying numbers with many digits all of which being 1) when I heard the wooden steps creek under the weight of my sister coming upstairs. I efficiently escaped without being seen: I glanced at the page number, shut the book, put it back on the shelf, and scrammed.

It wasn’t for the next few days until I would have the time to come back to read the book that I would find that my mind would drift off to in math class at school. When the day came, I, slightly more confidently, went back to my sister’s room, laid back down in the imprint that was still there from my last study session, took the book out of the shelf and flipped to the right page, and started to read. Again, I cannot recall how much time passed, but I can say that I figured that my sister, who seemed to only hanker math when she had to, wouldn’t miss the book, so I took it with me. That night, I read until my eyelids were heavy and I had to read each sentence several times through to understand it. But I can assure you that it was not long until I finished it.

Though I cannot recall every bit of information contained in the book, I can confidently say that without it, I would not have the same interests that I do today. It was the first time that I had independently taken strides in learning. As a look back on the book for the first time in close to 10 years, I get nostalgic on all of the small things that I learned from the book like the still incomprehensible idea of infinitely long decimals and the mind bending recurrence of the Fibonacci Sequence in nature. At the time, I thought nothing of the significance of the cover of the book. But now I realize that I fell into the author’s trap -- I didn’t see it as a book about the wretched, inescapable topic of math that many young kids see as an inferno. I was enlightened  with curiosity as to why the hell a devil was holding a pencil rather than a traditional pitchfork -- it almost seems like it was everyone’s intention to get me involved with stem.
