My sister and I, two years apart from each other (‘1 and two thirds!’ I always used to say), attended the same elementary school up the street from our home. At the end of her fifth grade, she decided not to go to the local middle school, but to apply to a private school. I did not think much of it at the time as I had no reason to; the last thing on a third grader’s mind is middle school. But when I got to the end of fifth grade, my parents proposed the same question as they did to my sister, I made the same decision as her. I made the mistake of only applying to the same school as my sister and when I was declined, I was stuck. I later decided to come to Beaver at the last minute in early August. I remember pacing with my parents on our deck late in the summer, trying my hardest to do the math on why this was supposed to be a hard decision. To this day, I still do not know whether I made the right choice. At the time, I did not understand how much of my childhood the decision would affect. Looking back, I realize that my life would be unparalleled to what it is now. Some days, I am full of regret with the fact that if I would have turned out just as happy not changing schools, why should my family pay so much anyway? Though I will never know life not going to middle and high school at Beaver, I've learned that the decisions that we make in life only guide us in a direction, they don’t define our future.
