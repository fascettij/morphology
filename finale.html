To this day, I often find myself recalling back to the moments that stood out to me. In spite of not knowing how, or even if, they would affect me later in life when taking place, I somehow subconsciously held onto the memories. For example, the other day I had finished my homework early and had a rare few hours to myself. I felt the need to plan out my time to take advantage of the opportunity that I may not get again for another week or two. My first instinct was to go pick up my book, <i>11/22/63</i> by Stephen King, again. But then I thought, that my time would be better spent watching a television show in Spanish, or maybe doing a bit of math SAT preparation. The ideas kept coming. After a few minutes of thinking I forced myself to stop. I came to the realization that I was not normal by any means. Any of my friends would jump straight to social media or hanging out with each other. Though there is not one right answer for what to do with your spare time, I learned that I was unique in that I would rather spend that time teaching myself something. My love for learning is something that I have grown to recognize how it shapes my character. If I hadn't taken the extra math classes when I was younger, or the extra language classes, or done whatever thing I now reflect on to be beneficial, I would not be the student, son, curiositor, athlete, friend, or person that I am today.
