Ever since I was in Kindergarten, my parents signed me up for a program called Russian Math (I’m not really sure if this is the real name of the company, but it’s what my family called it because of all of the teachers had almost incomprehensible Russian accents). Every Sunday afternoon, my mom would gather me and my sister, who is two grades ahead of me, and strap us into the minivan. She would gear us up with our Nintendo DS, hoping they would entertain us for the forty five minute drive. In the regular case that my sister and I either got car sick or too bored, we would take a pit stop at the McDonald’s part way along the drive to pick up a ten-piece-chicken-nugget that we would share for the last fifteen minutes of driving. Once we got there, I spent two hours sitting in a room with a bunch of second graders and an instructor with a Russian accent who spat out simple algebra that I would eventually be allowed to learn in regular school in three years by one of my reluctant teacher who got tired of me being so persistent. At the time, the simple problems like 2x + 5 = 13 seemed like a marathon compared to what I was used to doing. I would understand the concepts of multi step problems, but doing them in practice was something I had yet to master. While procrastinating the complex problems, I would wonder what kinds of college level math that my sister was doing in her fourth grade class -- it ended up to be elementary geometry and talks of exponents. The first half hour would always go by slower than I could imagine. The middle hour would pass at a surprisingly regular rate, as we would do independent practice work. The last half hour would somehow pass slower than the first thirty minutes; the time was spent introducing a new subject which we would then get a packet for homework for the next Sunday.

After the class, I would meet my sister in the hallway that vertexed our two classrooms and wait for the crowds of rushing kids to pass. About fifteen minutes later, when it was just us and the teachers left, we would step out of the building a look out for our mother, who was unsurprisingly just pulling in. The return ride home was just like the former, but there were no stops, as we all just wanted to get home as soon as possible. I would go to school as a normal kindergartener: class five days of the week and learning next to nothing. When math time came along, I would patiently sit in the back doing the simple worksheets with problems like 3 + 5 and 9 - 2. The school days would come and go and Saturday was my only free day. On Sundays, I would grind out the homework packet that was given to me the Sunday before from Russian Math to finish it just in time to jump back into the minivan and look forward to my chicken nuggets.

Little did I realize during my Kindergarten class, that I did Russian Math for those moments of boredom and wondering, because my parents knew that it is better to feel ahead than it is to feel behind. Whether it was the addictive pride that I was feeling for knowing more or a genuine curiosity in math, I now believe that Russian Math was what ignited my interests through my upper secondary education, and maybe even further.
