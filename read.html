Reading for me had always been different from how it should have been. The first time I attempted to conquer a book of more than a few hundred pages, I would either find myself ‘accidentally’ flipping two or more pages rather than one at a time or getting to the end of a page and realizing that I had not taken in any of the words. 10 year old Jonathan was too self absorbed to think anything of it.

The one thing that stood out to me, though, was in fourth and fifth grade. One day in each grade, I was pulled from my class to spend 45 or so minutes with a teacher to take a reading test. During the test, she gave me a short stack of flashcards and asked me to pronounce the words and she had me read a little story and tell her about it. I didn’t think anything of it, I just assumed that everyone did it sooner or later.
